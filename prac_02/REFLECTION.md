# CP1404 Practical Reflection

**What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?**  
I roughly went through about 70% to 80% of the content, but there was still a small portion that I didn't finish 
reading.

**What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?**  
Usually, I watch it at home in the evening, for about an hour. I will review the parts I don't understand repeatedly.
I will watch it again during my free time.

**What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?**  
The practical exercises are generally completed on time every week, and I also double-check and re-type the code several
times by myself. I think this is quite helpful.

**What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?**  
Sometimes I wait until the very end to watch the video, which makes me feel inefficient. Later on, I really want to 
finish it earlier.

**What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?**  
Sometimes when doing exercises, if one is too fast and doesn't check carefully enough, it's easy to make small mistakes 
that can only be discovered after several rechecks. From now on, every time I do my homework, I will spend more time 
running the code several times to ensure its correctness.

**What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?**  
Now the code is much clearer than at the beginning. I'm used to writing the main() function first and then the 
individual functions. The naming is also much more standardized than before. Writing a lot of code does indicate that 
one has gained experience.
